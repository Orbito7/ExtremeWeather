        <p>Natural disasters are being amplified in strength, amount and intensity.
          Some examples of disasters include floods, blizzards, thunderstorms, droughts.
          The glaciers melting are also a big one because they are causing mass flooding
          and some parts of the arctic are just completely disappearing.
          The damage from these events are dreadful for both environment and humans

        <p>With extreme events like flooding or even hurricanes, they often rip through critical
          human infrastructure if they are strong enough such as hospitals. When places like hospitals or even 
          elder care facilities are broken, it leaves many people stranded and vulnerable. It brings new problems 
          or strengthens old problems because they don't have power to run the machines protecting those people. 
          This is also a reason why so many deaths occur, there are not many fail safes for natural disasters being this powerful.
