        <p>Climate change has a significant impact on the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.
            Climate change is also a massive issue because of the large amounts of greenhouse gases humans emit on a day-to-day basis.
            Burning of oil in our cars, gas heating and many more of these little things add up greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and speed up climate change which then makes 
            extreme weather even worse than ever before.

          <li>Carbon Dioxide (Biggest one)</li>
          <p>Carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil, as well as through the burning of solid waste, and the destruction of trees and other organic materials.</p>
          <li>Methane</li>
          <p>Methane is released during the extraction, processing and transportation of coal, natural gas and oil. Additionally, methane is also produced by the digestion process of livestock such as cows and sheep.</p>
          <li>Nitrous Oxide</li>
          <p>Nitrous oxide is released into the atmosphere from various sources, including farming and land-use practices, industrial processes, the burning of fossil fuels and waste, and the treatment of sewage.
