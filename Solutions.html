            <li>Windmills</li>
            <p>Windmills are like giant fans that use the wind to make electricity. The wind spins the big fan blades around, which makes a machine inside turn and create power that we can use in our homes and schools.</p>
            <li>Solar Panels</li>
            <p>Solar panels are devices that harness the energy from the sun and convert it into electrical power. This process is achieved through the use of photovoltaic cells, which are made of semiconductor materials such as silicon. These cells absorb photons of light and release electrons, generating a flow of electricity.</p>
            <li>Hydroelectricity</li>
            <p>Hydroelectricity is a way to make electricity using moving water. We use the energy from the moving water to turn a turbine, which then generates electricity.</p>

        <p>The fewer greenhouse gas emmisions that we as humans add to the environment, helps the atmosphere not trap as much on earth causing the planet to heat up. 
            Most greenhouse gases we emit are from energy sources that we frequently use such as burning fossil fuels.
            By switching to more environmently friendly sources, we can slow down the major issue of climate change.
